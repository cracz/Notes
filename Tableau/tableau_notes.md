### Connecting to Data
* The left column shows various ways that you can "connect" to data.
* File types: 
    * Excel sheet
    * Text file
    * JSON file
    * Microsoft Access
    * PDF file
    * Spatial file
    * Statistical file

* Servers:
    * OData
    * Google Drive
    * Perhaps more that must be installed to use?

* Tableau will automatically identify the data types of each column. This is shown in the bottom half, left side: ``Table details`` when collapsed.
* Data symbols:
    * \# = Number (whole or decimal)
    * Abc = String
    * Calendar = Date
    * Globe = String with a Geographic Role

* Data types:
    * Number (whole or decimal)
    * Strings (can have a geographic role set)
    * Date
    * Date & Time
    * Boolean
    * Spatial (geometric or geographic data)

### Dataset Relationships

* Dragging a second sheet to the right will change to a view of the relationship between your active sheets. This is the ``Edit Relationship`` view.

* Tables are related based on common fields.

* The ``Noodle`` at the top between the two table names shows a summary of the relationship if you hover over it. Click on the noodle to display the ``Edit Relationship`` view again if necessary.

* With a relationship arranged, one can then use the joined tables as a ``Data Source`` by going down to the bottom left and clicking ``Sheet #``.

* (Tableau Public browser version) Save your data source into a Workbook with the ``Publish`` button at the top-right of the Sheet # page.
